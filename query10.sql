/* You're tasked with giving more contextual information to rail stops to fill the `stop_desc` field in a GTFS feed. 
Using any of the data sets above, PostGIS functions (e.g., `ST_Distance`, `ST_Azimuth`, etc.), and PostgreSQL string functions, build a description (alias as `stop_desc`) for each stop. 
Feel free to supplement with other datasets (must provide link to data used so it's reproducible), and other methods of describing the relationships. 
PostgreSQL's `CASE` statements may be helpful for some operations. 

**Structure:**
  ```sql
  (
      stop_id integer,
      stop_name text,
      stop_desc text,
      stop_lon double precision,
      stop_lat double precision
  )
  ```

  As an example, your `stop_desc` for a station stop may be something like "37 meters NE of 1234 Market St" (that's only an example, feel free to be creative, silly, descriptive, etc.)

  **Tip when experimenting:** Use subqueries to limit your query to just a few rows to keep query times faster. Once your query is giving you answers you want, scale it up. E.g., instead of `FROM tablename`, use `FROM (SELECT * FROM tablename limit 10) as t`.
